# Phase Plant Init Presets

The `init` preset is the default preset used when creating a new preset.

This contains copies of the `init` preset for most version of Phase Plant.  
They are useful when a new feature is added, when reverse engineering and
as a test to make sure every version is readable and writable.

Some preset files may have exactly the same contents. This is expected. They 
should be included anyway as a record that there were no changes. They do not 
take any more space in the Git repository.
